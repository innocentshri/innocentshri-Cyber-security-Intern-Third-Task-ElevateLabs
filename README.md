# Task 3 - Networking Basics for Cyber Security

## Objective
To understand basic networking concepts and analyze raal network traffic using Wireshark.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark (Primary Tool)

## Concepts Covered
- IP Address
- MAC Address
- TCP and UDP
- DNS
- HTTP vs HTTPS
- Packet Sniffing
- TCP Three-Way Handshake

## Steps Performed 

1. Installed Wireshark.
2. Started live packet capture on the active neetwork interface.
3. Applied protocol filters:
   - 'tcp
   - 'udp'
   - 'dns'
   - 'http'
4. Observed TCP three-way handshake:
   - SYN
   - SYN-ACK
   - ACK
5. Captured DNS queries and responses.
6. Identified difference between:
   - Plain-text traffic (HTTP)
   - Encrypted traffic (HTTPS)
7. Saved the packet capture as 'capture.pcapng'.

## Observation

1. TCP uses a three-step process to establish a connection, which ensures reliability.
